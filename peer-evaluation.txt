Peer's repository: https://github.com/Ethan-source/05-Space-Shooter



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?

 I learned that you could use multiple characters in a single sprite.

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

 I honestly didn't see anything I would apply to my projects.

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

 You could have music, single characters per sprite so that the boundaries make more sense, and more interesting visuals.

What could have been clearer or better commented?

 The ending could be clearer with a victory message, but that was not required.

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

 Forking it was confusing because it kept telling me it was not committed to the master.

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

 Yes it does.

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

 It seemed descriptive enough to me.

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

You perfectly hit all of the requirements of the assignment.
